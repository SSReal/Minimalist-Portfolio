# Minimalist Portfolio
This is a minimalist template for a portfolio site, created using React, Material UI and Styled-Components

## Layout
In the center, there is a social links section, in which the github profile, linkedin, and email links are placed, along with the name and photo

Below that are three buttons: Projects, Skills and Experience, which open the requisite section on the right and the social links section shifts to the left to make room for it.

The sections themselves are independently scrollable to reveal their contents, and the individual items can be collapsed by clicking on them

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
